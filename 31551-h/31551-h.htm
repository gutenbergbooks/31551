<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>There is hardly a person who, as a school-boy,
had not received the fire of imagination and the
stimulus for adventure and a roaming life
through the stirring narratives concerning Captain
Kidd and other well-known sea rovers. A
certain ineffable glamor metamorphosed these
robbers into heroes, and lent an inalienable license
to their “calling,” so that the songster and
romancist found in them and their deeds prolific
and genial themes, while the obscure suggestions
of hidden treasures and mysterious
caves have inspired many expeditions in quest of
buried fortunes which, like the Argo of old, have
carried their Jasons to the mythical Colchis.</p>

<p>The pens of Byron, Scott, Poe, Stevenson, Russell,
and Stockton, and the musical genius of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Wagner, were steeped in the productive inspiration
of these lawless adventurers, and Kingsley
found in Lundy Island, the erstwhile nest of
the reckless tribe, a subject for his “Westward
Ho!”</p>

<p>Byron, in “The Corsair,” sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O’er the glad waters of the dark-blue sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Survey our empire, and behold our home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are our realms, no limits to their sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ours the wild life in tumult still to range<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From toil to rest, and joy in every change.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Piracy was the growth of maritime adventure,
and developed with the advancement of commerce.
The Phœnicians and Greeks were especially
apt in the interstate wars which frequently
degenerated into rapine and plunder,
and with them piracy became a recognized enterprise.
In Homeric times it was dignified with
a respect worthy of a nobler cause—a sentiment
in which the freebooters of later centuries took
arrogant pride. The pirate—cruel, vicious, debased
to the lowest degree of turpitude—established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>a moral code governing his actions and
circumscribing his wanton license, and it was
in the rigorous observance of these “trade laws”
and customs of their realm that this abortive
sense of honor manifested itself.</p>

<p>The successes of the Phœnicians and Greeks
soon made the Mediterranean the theatre of
maritime robbery, in later years conducted
under the authority, sanction, and immunity of
the Barbary powers. In fact, so reckless had the
enterprise become that the temerity of the free
lances knew no bounds, and headquarters, so to
speak, were established, and for a long time
maintained, at Cilicia.</p>

<p>The vigorous campaign of Pompey in 67 <small>B.C.</small>
against the pirates was but the precursor of that
systematic defence which the nations of the
world eventually adopted. The Hanseatic League
of the cities of Northern Germany and neighboring
states, no doubt, had its origin in the
necessitous combination of merchants to resist
the attacks of the Norsemen. England sent out
many expeditions to destroy the pestiferous freebooters
who swarmed from the African coast, and
finally, in 1815, the United States sent Decatur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>to Algiers to annihilate the nefarious corsairs,
who had thrived and become brazen in their
recklessness during the three centuries of their
ascendant power. The incursions of the Algerine
pirates were made as far north as England, Ireland,
and Iceland, and through them an iniquitous
slave trade was developed. The law of
nations did not place its ban upon this slave
traffic until by statute England and the United
States attempted to obliterate this ineradicable
blot upon our civilization, and only a half century
ago Austria, Prussia, and Russia declared
it to be piracy.</p>

<p>Piracy, by the law of nations, is punishable
with death within the jurisdiction of any nation
under whose flag the capture may have been
made, for the pirate is the common enemy of
mankind. Although it has passed the zenith of
its perverse glory, and modern naval development
has made it impracticable and impossible,
vestiges of piracy remain in the Malay Archipelago
and the China Sea. As recently as 1864
five men were hanged in London on such a
charge.</p>

<p>Privateering, the resourceful auxiliary to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>weak navy, is also piracy, though not recognized
so by the law of nations. The private ship
which, under the authority of letters of marque
and reprisal issued by the government, made
war upon a hostile power, was always an indispensable
adjunct to naval warfare. England
considered our privateer Paul Jones a pirate.
During the Civil War the Confederate cruisers
were termed pirates, and the <i>Alabama</i> claims
made upon England for damage done by the
<i>Alabama</i>, the <i>Florida</i>, and the <i>Shenandoah</i> arose
from permitting privateers to depart from her
ports.</p>

<p>The rise and sway of the corsairs of Algiers,
Tunis, and Tripoli, developing from disorganized
piracy, was evidently the result of the persecution
of the Moors of Spain in the sixteenth
century, who, exiled and retributive, sought revenge
and lucre in the attacks upon the argosies
from India to Spain. Their successes attracted
adventurers from Asia Minor, and thus augmented
they acquired formidable power, established
citadels and states, governed by daring and sagacious
leaders, and levied blackmail upon Christian
countries for the protection of commerce. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>was not until the vigorous campaign of Decatur
that the backbone of this sanctioned lawlessness
of the Barbary States was broken and safety
upon the high seas of the East assured.</p>

<p>The bold character of these marauders can
be best imagined when we reflect that in the
seventeenth century the Algerine pirates cruised
in the English Channel, blockaded the Lord
Deputy of Ireland in 1635 for weeks in an English
port, where he remained helpless till succored
by an English man-of-war, and actually
entered the harbor of Cork and carried away
eight fishermen, who subsequently were sold as
slaves in Algiers. But, as we have seen, piracy,
which at one time was the formidable enemy of
mankind and a menace to progress and development,
is now merely a matter of history.</p>

<p>The limits of this article will not permit any
extended review of lawless maritime depredations
in its various phases, but it may be within
our province to refer for a moment to the buccaneers
and filibusters of our own continent.
The late war in Cuba brought the filibusters
once more into prominence. The term applies to
one who, warring upon another country, does so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>not for private gain, but for public benefit, and
refers generally to those who had attempted to
conquer certain Spanish-American possessions
upon the plea that the objective country was
suffering from anarchy and oppression. The
theory was that salvation could only be found
in annexation to the United States; and if this
be so, there are many spiritual filibusters within
our borders to-day. The term has now become
generally applicable to adventurers from the
United States, but was unknown under that
name until the expedition of Lopez to Cuba in
1850. Aaron Burr was a filibuster, although we
may justly doubt the virtue of his motives.
William Walker, perhaps the foremost of them
all, invaded Lower California in 1854, attempted
to found a republic, was defeated, and later conquered
Nicaragua and became its president, only
to shift about in his meteoric career of destiny
and sail against Honduras, where he was captured,
court-martialled, and shot in 1860.</p>

<p>It is to the buccaneers, however, that the history
of piracy is indebted for the “glory” which
may fill its pages; it is to the men of the stamp
of Morgan, Dampier, Peter of Dieppe, and Van
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Horn, who by their courage, dash, and spasmodic
chivalry lent sufficient romance to their misdeeds
as to obscure the crime, that we owe the stirring
tales of the conquests in the West Indies and
South America. And no less a pirate was Francis
Drake, who, despite his knighthood and the
official countenance the Elizabethan government
lent to his attacks upon Spanish galleons
and cities, stands forth as one of the greatest free
lances of the world. His history is unique, brilliant,
and commanding; his service for his country
and the attack upon the Spanish Armada
atoning, as it were, for his piratical crimes.
What irony of fate, that this wonderful man, a
knight of England, a member of Parliament, a
warrior and sailor, a robber and conqueror,
should now lie in a lead coffin at the bottom of
the sea off Porto Rico, conquered by death while
on his way to the islands so often the object of his
pillage!</p>

<p>The constant warring of Spain against the
powers of the world, not at home but in her western
possessions, finally led to that outlawry which
under the name of buccaneers terrorized the
Caribbean Sea during the sixteenth and seventeenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>centuries. In 1625 the island of St. Christopher
was settled by the buccaneers to establish
a base; and later the island of Tortuga was captured,
which became the scene of constant warfare
until the capture of Jamaica in 1655.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[*]</a>
Pre-eminent amongst the buccaneers of this period
who made the Spanish Main a synonym for
robbery and bloodshed was Captain Henry Morgan,
who, as a pirate, captured Jamaica, was
knighted by Charles II., and later made Deputy
Governor of the island. He it was who led the
buccaneers to the South Sea, opening for them a
rich field for booty, by marching across the Isthmus
of Panama, fighting a battle and capturing
and plundering the city, and, seizing the Spanish
vessels in the harbor, set sail for the South Sea,
returning by way of Cape Horn with fabulous
prizes. After the capture of Cartagena in 1697,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>the organization of these intrepid, daring, and
able freebooters disrupted, and the glory waned
and vanished; the degeneracy was rapid and
complete, till cut-throats and villainous outlaws
took the place of their great predecessors.</p>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[*]</span></a> <i>Driven from St. Christopher, the expatriated
French and English outlaws settled in San Domingo,
an island over whose plains thousands of wild cattle
roamed, and found excellent revenue in the capture
of these beasts and the sale of the flesh and hides.
The peculiar manner of smoking the beef and preserving
the hides, known as “bucchanning,” gave
them their name.</i></p>
</div>


<p>History shows that in our own country pirates
appeared along the Carolina coast as far back
as 1565, and before the settlement of the country
by the English, under charter of Charles II., the
pirates of the Spanish Main occupied the coast,
the many harbors lending refuge and safe retreat,
while permitting the burying of treasures.</p>

<p>The Carolinas remained friendly to pirates
with a persistency of popular favor which was
well-nigh ineradicable. And this is quite readily
understood when we reflect that the depredations
were committed upon ships of His Catholic Majesty,
the foe of England, and that the pirates
brought their gold and silver plate to the colonies
for sale and barter, thus bringing wealth and resource
to the struggling communities; and, lastly,
the example and sanction set by the king in
knighting Henry Morgan, the leading pirate of
the day. It was impossible to obtain a jury to
convict any one upon the charge of piracy, and
so the authorities found themselves helpless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>The best known of all the pirates in America is
beyond doubt Captain Kidd, of whom we all
have sung:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, my name is Captain Kidd,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As I sailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As I sailed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, my name is Captain Kidd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God’s laws I did forbid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And right wickedly I did,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As I sailed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The English government, alarmed at the bold
and heinous offences committed by the Indian pirates
in the Colonies, issued to him letters of
marque against the French and the ubiquitous
rover of the coast, whose “Jolly Roger” floating
from the mizzen, with its sinister portend, struck
terror to the helpless merchantman.</p>

<p>His work was efficient and sweeping, and in
1691 the Council of the City of New York presented
him £100, in appreciation of his energetic
campaign. In 1697 he reached Madagascar to
annihilate the pirates in the Eastern waters, but
soon strange reports reached England concerning
his actions, and it developed that he had fallen
a victim to the seductive aphorism, “the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>pirate is the free child of the sea,” and in the
degree as he was their destroyer, so he rose as
their energetic leader. Subsequently he sailed
to the West Indies, Delaware, Oyster Bay, and,
burying his treasures on Gardiner’s Island, set
sail for Boston, where he was captured, sent to
England, and hanged on Execution Dock, London.
The treasures found on Gardiner’s Island
amounted to $170,000, and to this day hopes are
entertained of other buried booty.</p>

<p>The scope of Mr. Herrmann’s lecture is not to
embrace the history of piracy, but to narrate the
incidents and vicissitudes of a pirate’s life and
to illustrate their <i>modus operandi</i>. His story
depicts to us the terrible misdeeds as practised
by those ferocious and heartless demons, amongst
whom Captain Fly, Captain Teach, the Blackbeard,
and Captain North were the most notorious.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE" id="LECTURE"></a>A LECTURE.</h2>


<p>The limitations of a lecture will not permit the
discussion of the subject upon an extended scope,
nor will it allow a more than cursory review of
the general doings, adventures, and methods of
pirates in general, leaving the historical treatment
for another occasion.</p>

<p>The Latin word <i>piratia</i> defines the crime, answering
to robbery on land, with the distinction
that it is committed upon the high seas or navigable
waters generally. The law of nations has
defined it as the taking of property from others
by open violence, with intent to steal, and without
lawful authority, on the sea. And with the
stringency arising from the ever-growing depredations,
and the community of interests of the
civilized world, the crime was made punishable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>by death, and jurisdiction was recognized in that
country into whose ports the pirate may be carried.</p>

<p>Piracy flourished in its reckless dare-deviltry
and wanton lawlessness about one hundred and
fifty years ago, its most productive operations
being confined to the Spanish Main, over whose
vast paths the newly discovered wealth and hidden
treasures of the New World were carried.
The unprotected state of commerce permitted
these piratical invasions with immunity and thus
allowed this nefarious trade to flourish and develop
unchecked and uncontrolled. By reason
of this the lawless element of the community was
encouraged and allured by the visions of fabulous
riches with the attendant excitement incident
to its capture. Pirates, as a class, were
principally outlaws, social outcasts, or ’longshoremen
of a desperate and brutal character,
who deemed it the more enjoyable the more hazardous
their undertaking, and who considered it
safer to maraud on the high seas than upon the
land, in constant fear of the minions of the law.
But not all pirates were of this character. Some,
not inherently vicious nor absolutely depraved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>had adopted this lawless calling by reason of
some stigma which deprived them of their social
position; others, by reason of their indolence;
and others from sheer necessity, who found in
their dire distress the justification for the dangerous
step.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">

<img src="images/illo_01_th.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Whenever a band of these men had determined
upon their new enterprise, they immediately
seized some available ship in the shore waters,
which was frequently accomplished by two or
three approaching in a rowboat, in the guise of
purchasers of merchandise. As a rule, a vessel,
when in shore waters, is inadequately protected
by guards, and thus the pirates, finding the deck
in their control, would overcome the watch and,
with drawn pistols and threats of death, proceed
to make them helpless prisoners. With practical
control of the vessel thus assured, some of the
number would stand sentry at the hatchways
while a signal to the shore brought the reinforcement
of their comrades in crime. Should the
captured crew show remonstrance or any intimation
of resistance, the swords, cutlasses, and
heavy chains were most effective as a quietus;
and thus with sails all set, and flying the flag of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>the home port as a mantle to their knavery, they
sailed forth to some small town in search of provisions,
to dispose of their merchandise, release
their prisoners (or, as frequently happened,
maroon them upon some desolate island), and
thus equipped and provisioned, with magazines
ammunitioned, they set forth in search of prey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<a name="illustration_02" id="illustration_02"></a>

<img src="images/illo_02_th.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Not infrequently the vessel captured would
prove too small and insufficient for marauding
expeditions upon the high seas, and unable to
give battle or a spirited chase to a sturdy merchantman.
In such event, their operations were
confined to the coast-line and in the harbors
which had been located by spies<a href="#illustration_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as having richly
laden vessels ready for the outward journey;
and, having ascertained the date of departure,
the ship’s complement, its possible fighting
strength, and its destination, a close watch was
set, avoiding, however, all cause for suspicion,
and, with lights extinguished, the careful, silent
watch was kept till the midnight hour. As eight
bells rang out upon the darkness, and the unsuspecting
sailor keeping the midnight watch looked
blankly into the night, several rowboats, with
occupants armed to the teeth, would be lowered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>and without a splash ride the waters, over which
they glided, carrying the sea-robbers to the grim
sides of their intended prey.<a href="#illustration_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">

</div>

<p>In many cases the decks, by reason of the
fancied security afforded by the harbor, would
be deserted, and, taking advantage of this opportunity,
the attacking party quickly leap over the
sides and, under the noiselessly given commands
of their captain, creep stealthily to the hatchways,
cautiously taking their positions so that no
miscalculations might frustrate their designs.
And so, invading below decks, with weapons
poised and every fibre on the alert, the concerted
attack upon the sleeping victims would be given.
With one fell swoop, and with the savagery born
of their nefarious undertaking, the crew would
be ruthlessly butchered, some few, perhaps, escaping
in the general skirmish and fleeing up
the gangway, only to be struck down by the villain
on guard.<a href="#illustration_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For the present we will close
our eyes to the awful picture of torture and murder
here enacted, to revert to it upon a subsequent
occasion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">

<a href="images/illo_04.jpg">
<img src="images/illo_04_th.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>With the crew slain, gagged or in chains, with
all possible resistance overcome, the coming of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>the day was awaited. And as the first faint
streaks of gray broke in upon the darkness of the
night and the harbingers of the dawn sent their
shafts athwart the horizon, the ship rode proudly
at her anchor, silently and stately, giving no
indication of the carnage of the night. The
creaking of the chain around the capstan was
but the mariners’ music to sing the glory of the
voyage to be begun, and so, without creating the
least suspicion in the vessels lying round about,
the captors brought their prize abreast their old
vessel, transferred their stock of provisions and
merchandise,<a href="#illustration_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> if any, to the newly captured
vessel, and, thus prepared, sailed grandly out of
the harbor. When once again the breath of the
ocean bellied their sails and sped them on to the
unknown argosy, the dead, vanquished crew was
rudely cast into the sea, without the semblance
of respect for the dead, the decks thoroughly
scrubbed, the scuppers flushed, the inventory
prepared, and so, once again, the course was set
for a port in which to dispose of their cargo.<a href="#illustration_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The argus-eyed lookout stationed far up in the
foremast scanned every point of the far-reaching
horizon,<a href="#illustration_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> signalling to his mates the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>of a spar against the heavens. Then, with course
changed and wheel set, and sped on by conspiring
winds, they bore down upon the unfortunate
vessel, displaying at the proper moment the ominous
and fateful black flag and its ghastly emblem
of skull and cross-bones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="illustration_05" id="illustration_05"></a>
<a href="images/illo_05.jpg">
<img src="images/illo_05_th.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Thus, for months perhaps, the fitful winds
and steady currents carried them hither and
thither, ever alert, ever ready for combat and
plunder. With guns primed and powder-horn
stocked, these plunderers roamed the trackless
sea, at times with impatience and drooping
hopes, until the sight of a large, heavily riding
merchantman sent their blood a-leaping and
transformed the deck into a scene of feverish
activity. If we recall the peaceful errand of
the merchantmen and reflect that their armature
was little calculated to cope with the war-waging
outlaws, it is quite apparent how gross the inequality
of the struggle must necessarily be.
While most of the merchantmen carried defensive
armament, the unpractised, unskilled
crew made the guns in their hands little more
than ineffective. As the pirate ship approached,
she displayed the same flag flying from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>stern of the merchantman; and with the crew
hidden below decks, in order not to betray their
purpose, the vessels approached sufficiently close
to enable the pirates to fire a broadside into the
unsuspecting vessel and demand immediate surrender.<a href="#illustration_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
At times a vessel, by reason of its
superiority, would succeed in outsailing the pirates,
but frequently the result was most disastrous.
Often a stout-hearted merchantman, seeing
that capture was inevitable, would offer battle
in desperation, firing volley after volley of
stone shot, the pirates, stubborn, furious, tenacious,
fighting with all the ferocity their natures
were capable of, resulting, after a decisive contest,
in the lowering of the merchantman flag in
disgrace and humiliation. With the lowering of
the sails as an indication of surrender, the pirates
sent out several boats with armed men, under the
command of a chosen leader, who at once placed
the captain under arrest and demanded the
ship’s papers under pain of death. This request
was usually, though unwillingly, acceded to.
The old vessel was thereupon dismantled, the
captured boat refitted, and, burning the hull of
the forsaken vessel,<a href="#illustration_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the pirates once more set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>sail, with the imprisoned captain and crew in
chains cast into the dark, foul hold of the ship.
Immunity was sometimes granted the captives
upon their taking the oath of allegiance to the
piratical horde. Can we not imagine how the
intense anguish and unendurable torture finally
forced from the unwilling lips the fearful avowal
of allegiance?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">

<p>We can plainly observe the purpose of the
pirates in endeavoring to capture a large, powerful,
and speedy vessel, for that was the only
safeguard of their barbarous trade. They readily
recognized that success and security depended
solely upon speed to overtake a fleeing ship
or to escape a powerful adversary. Their motto,
“He who fights and runs away may live to fight
another day,” was in reality the only literature
the bold and adventurous pirate would comprehend
or accept. Therefore, well equipped in a
stanch, trim vessel, with the lockers filled, the
magazines stocked, the guns aimed and ready for
action, they were brave enough to combat even
a man-of-war. The books are replete with the
thrilling accounts of engagements and set battles
waged between pirates and resisting armed merchantmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>resulting completely in victory for
the black flag which so defiantly floated from the
mizzenmast. The gradual progress and growth
of the energetic sea-robbers, from the looting of
vessels riding peacefully at anchor in the harbors
to the management of large and seaworthy
craft, permitted them to undertake long and
seemingly endless cruises, the most daring of
which being undertaken, no doubt, by that notorious
chieftain, Captain Nathaniel North,<a href="#illustration_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> who
cruised from Newfoundland to the West Indies,
then across the Southern Atlantic to the Cape of
Good Hope, thence via Mozambique to the Indian
Ocean, and northward to the Red Sea, traversing
the same track to the Arabian Sea and
East Indies—a voyage of 28,670 miles, the toy
of the monsoon, the victim of the typhoon, and
the sport of the trade-winds in the many latitudes.
History has reserved a rather infamous
niche for such freebooters as Thomas Howard,
Captain Misson, Captain Fly, and Captain
Kidd, whose voyages and exploits have given
themes to the historian, the narrator, and the
novelist. It was during these long cruises that
the coast towns suffered through the depredations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>plundering, and pillage, and the inhabitants
put in constant fear of these sudden and
vicious onslaughts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<a name="illustration_07" id="illustration_07"></a>
<a href="images/illo_07.jpg">
<img src="images/illo_07_th.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Not infrequently the pirates selected some
desolate locality in which to bury their treasures
and store their stolen goods,<a href="#illustration_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> generally building
a “village” inland, well hidden in the foliage of
the forests or tropical shrubbery, and perhaps
inaccessible save through the devious paths cunningly
planned to secure immunity from attack.
These natural defences were supplemented with
a series of forts as a further protection from the
incursions of the natives. The internecine wars
so fiercely waged by the inhabitants of the African
East Coast frequently brought the vanquished
to these “villages” to secure protection—a
safety usually given in exchange for practical
slavery in tilling the ground and cultivating
crops.</p>

<p>From time almost immemorial the word <i>pirate</i>
has been synonymous with all that is villainous,
bloodthirsty, and cruel, and capture by a gang of
these assassins meant indescribable torture and
suffering, and we will devote a few moments to
a consideration of these awful scenes; the sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>attacks, the vain attempts at flight, the desperate
hand-to-hand struggles for life, mingled
with the brutal yells, interspersed with the piteous
cries for mercy, followed by the horrible
silence which finally settles over the slippery
decks, and the gruesome spectacle of the dreadful
vandalism as the murderers proceed to strip
their victims.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="illustration_09" id="illustration_09"></a>

<img src="images/illo_09_th.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Generally, after a successful attack, the captain
of the unfortunate vessel would be placed
in chains and questioned as to the cargo and
treasures of his ship. A cutlass held menacingly
over him indicated the danger of untruth, and
frequently a savage gash brought a stubborn
and silent captain to submission. Inquisitorial
tortures, unrelieved by any mock civility, were
continued to extract further confessions from
the pain-racked prisoners. Devices born only of
a devilish instinct and fiendish delight suggested
all forms of suffering, and so the captain
was frequently tied to the ship’s pump and
surrounded with burning combustibles; or, fastened
to the deck, surrounded with gunpowder,
which they ignited; or his limbs were severed
from his body and his flesh prodded with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>points of the cutlass, the fiendish pirates forming
a circle around him for this inhuman “sport.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="illustration_10" id="illustration_10"></a>
<a href="images/illo_10.jpg">
<img src="images/illo_10_th.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Despite these awful tortures, confessions were
often suppressed, in the hope that the pirates
would allow the vessel to proceed on its way (as
was sometimes the case), and thus a part of the
treasures be saved. But all hope of succor or
consideration at the hands of these murderers
was idle. Unsatisfied with the mere acquisition
of booty, these human devils, devoid of the last
spark of compassion, would mete out to each
member of the crew and the passengers the most
unheard-of tortures which human depravity
could invent, for the amusement of the captors.
Some were tied to a windlass and pelted into
insensibility, or perhaps more charitable death.
Others were lashed with ropes and cast, almost
dead, into the sea; or, spiked hand and foot to<a href="#illustration_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
the deck, were exposed mercilessly to the hot
rays of the sun until the features were distorted
into unrecognizability; some were placed before
a gun and thus decapitated, while others were
tied back to back and thrown into the waters.
In fact, so low were these villainous wretches in
their degradation that only the most cruel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>cunningly devised torture could satiate their
bloodthirsty cravings—human hyenas, who
found rest only in the pains and shrieks of other
mortals. By far the most favorite pastime was
to make the victim “walk the plank” or hang
him to the yardarm<a href="#illustration_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—a suggestion of the retribution
suffered by the pirates when captured.
No word picture can present the awful orgies indulged
in by these social outcasts, who continued
their carnage, assault, and abuse until the last
victim had succumbed. Then, directing their attention
to the ship, it was quietly dismantled, set
adrift, or frequently burned to the water’s edge,
allowing the hull to float about, a rudderless
derelict.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<a name="illustration_11" id="illustration_11"></a>
<a href="images/illo_11.jpg">
<img src="images/illo_11_th.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>One must not form the impression, however,
that this reckless lawlessness was attended with
insubordination or lack of discipline. On the
contrary, they were rigorously governed by an
iron hand and by the unwritten “code of
honor.” A pirate entered upon “the account”
(a term meaning piracy) by taking the oath of
fealty to the cause, abjuring all social ties,
pledging himself never to desert his ship or defraud
his comrades or steal anything belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>to his fellows. Having thus bound him by an
oath firm and dreadful in its malediction upon
any violation of its terms, the organization is
completed by the selection of a captain, who,
usually, is the strongest, bravest, and most desperate
of them all, well calculated to keep the
crew in subjection. Mutiny and the spirit of insubordination
frequently raised its ominous
growl, to be quelled only by the fearlessness of
the captain and his ability to keep his men in
abject fear of his commands. It held the men
in the thralls of hypnotism, and in its efficaciousness
depended the safety of the captain and his
“loyal” adherents. With some crews the title
<i>Captain</i> did not convey autocratic power nor
dictatorial prerogatives, his power to command
absolutely being confined only to times of combat.
A usurpation of power frequently brought
death as a deterrent to any aspiring successor.
In those cases where the captain was not recognized
as the sole ruler, each man had a vote in
affairs of moment, and had an undivided interest
and title in all booty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;">
<a name="illustration_12" id="illustration_12"></a>
<a href="images/illo_12.jpg">
<img src="images/illo_12_th.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It can readily be understood how valueless the
cast-iron oath of the pirate must be when occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>makes its rejection convenient, and thus
apparent dissatisfaction with the captain or with
his commands have frequently caused those secret
plottings below decks, resulting in open revolt
or mutiny:—<a href="#illustration_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>pirate against pirate, brute
force matched against brute force for power and
supremacy. The severest punishment to a member
of the crew for thieving from a fellow-pirate
was marooning—slitting the ears and nose and
depositing the offender upon some desolate
island or lonely shore with but few provisions
and limited ammunition. Life was little prized,
for death had no terrors, and life beyond this
world entered not into their calculations. Their
fearlessness and courage was splendidly exampled
when Captain Teach, alias Black Beard,
appeared off Charleston in the year 1717 and
sent word to the Governor of the colony to send
out to him at once a certain number of medicine
chests, in failure of which the port would be
blockaded by his single vessel, and all persons
on board in-going and out-going ships killed and
their heads sent to the Governor as proof of the
execution of the threat. He also threatened to
set all ships on fire. It illustrates clearly in what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>dread these sea marauders were held in those
times, when we learn that the Governor immediately
complied with the demands and the embargo
was raised. It is recorded that in moments
of defeat pirates voluntarily have set fire to their
powder magazines and thus were blown to destruction
rather than plead for mercy. During
long cruises, when no ships upon the horizon line
varied the monotony of the daily routine, pastimes
were invented, each one out-rivalling the
other in sheer wickedness. Captain Teach considered
it rare sport to lock his men in the ship’s
hold and then set sulphur afire to ascertain how
long they could withstand asphyxiation. Yet
his greatest “bravery” was displayed (and
herein he developed commendable Spartan fortitude)
when he married fourteen times with a
fearlessness highly worthy of a better purpose!
His wickedness was as great as his fearlessness
was unbounded, but wickedness was voted manly
in a pirate and assured the esteem and admiration
of his comrades.</p>

<p>With the progression of events and the
growth of commerce, piracy waned, and gradually
the black flag which had so long swept the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Spanish Main was furled and drooped into the
sea over which it had so long defiantly floated.
The European governments made many futile
attempts to check the rapid development of the
unlawful enterprise, and many expeditions were
successful, resulting in the trial, condemnation,
and execution of the outlaws on land.</p>

<p>In England a proclamation of amnesty was
issued, insuring freedom and rights of citizenship
to all who renounced their calling—a privilege
which many accepted, only to find their
blood fire and yearn for the wild, aimless, and
adventurous roaming on the seas, which gradually
drew them back to their calling and away
from the restraints of civilization. The capture
of a pirate meant death, and, as no practicable
defence was available, the prisoners usually entrenched
themselves behind the plea that they
were kidnapped or shanghaied and were compelled
to enter into piracy for the preservation
of their lives. But piracy, with its harrowing
gruesomeness, its boldness and daring, its
romance and adventure, its plunder and murder,
its conflicts and reprisals, is a spectre of
the past, and now is chiefly confined to the rivers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>and harbors of the Far East and Northern Africa.
It has lost the glamor and enchanting,
romantic atmosphere which pervaded the career
of Captain Kidd and made him the worshipped
hero of every school-boy, or which inspired the
pen of a Scott, of an Edgar Allan Poe or Frank
R. Stockton, or put the charm to the tales of W.
Clark Russell, for pirates and piracy are now
dead, and live ingloriously only in the pages of
chronicling history.</p>
